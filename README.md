[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Prerequisites

This project requires specific versions of Node.js and pnpm to ensure consistency across all development environments.

### Required Versions

- **Node.js**: 22.17.1 (LTS)
- **pnpm**: 9.15.0 (managed by corepack)

### Setup Instructions

#### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

Run the setup script that will handle everything for you:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

#### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Install Node.js 22.17.1**

   If you're using fnm (recommended):

   ```bash
   fnm install 22.17.1
   fnm use 22.17.1
   ```

   If you're using nvm:

   ```bash
   nvm install 22.17.1
   nvm use 22.17.1
   ```

2. **Enable corepack** (this manages pnpm version automatically):

   ```bash
   corepack enable
   ```

3. **Verify versions**:
   ```bash
   node --version  # Should output: v22.17.1
   pnpm --version  # Should output: 9.15.0
   ```

The project includes:

- `.nvmrc` file for Node.js version management
- `.node-version` file for additional compatibility
- `packageManager` field in `package.json` for corepack
- `engines` field in `package.json` to enforce versions
